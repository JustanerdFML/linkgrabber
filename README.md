Linkgrabber Addon for Firefox for Qobuz Deezer and many more

Early stage, changes and tuning will come.
Install .xpi or .zip as Addon for Firefox. No other browsers tested yet, but should work on chrome aswell.

right now functionality is only creating formatted lists of tabs you have open in your browser right now. you can dl .txt in a list or in one line seperated by " ".
possible useable with other tools who could process those links ;)
